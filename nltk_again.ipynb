       "'THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT IN FIRST YEAR ALGEBRAAuthor(s): ELEANOR E. BOOHERReviewed work(s):Source: The Mathematics Teacher, Vol. 19, No. 2 (FEBRUARY, 1926), pp. 86-98Published by: National Council of Teachers of MathematicsStable \\n\\n\\nTHE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT IN FIRST YEAR ALGEBRA1 ELEANOR E. BOOHER We have all tried at various times in our lives to solve riddles and we have all observed others try to solve them too. Now when it comes to solving riddles folks may be classified roughly under two heads : those who give up if the answer does not come to their minds immediately and those who will try for hours. There are the easy givers up and those with the inquiring mind. The very fact that we have devoted a good part of our time to the study and teaching of mathematics must indicate that in our younger days, at least, we were not always with the easy givers up when occasionally a mathematical riddle was pro pounded to us from back of the teacher\\'s desk. Of course, in these days, mathematics is taught quite differently and many of the problems of the riddle type have given place to a more rational kind of exercise, but even so some of us have had ample oppor tunity to observe how folks react when riddles are assigned. They may show themselves to be the easy givers up or they may show the inquiring attitude of mind. Since the report was made by the National Committee on the Reorganization of Mathematics in Secondary Education, much publicity has been given to the use of the function concept as an organizing principle. Just how we can make use of this idea is a question which presents itself as something of a riddle to the members of our profession and so far as I know the answer is not yet forthcoming. But the national committee has succeeded in directing the attention of many folk who do possess the in quiring mind to the solution of this problem. If there is any satisfactory answer it will be found and if not, that fact too will be discovered. I believe that some time in the near future there is going to be an adequate answer, perhaps by one of you, in the form of a text book wherein the subject matter is so organized that the development of the habit of functional thinking is the main aim. 1Read Before the Mathematics Section of the High School Conference at University of Illinois, Nov. 19, 1925. \\nFUNCTION CONCEPT 87 Since Leibnitz and Newton invented the calculus, the function concept has dominated mathematics and all exact science, but it is only within the last decade than anyone seems to have had even a remote idea that teachers of secondary mathematics could make much use of the notion. Although the development of this idea stands out as one of the highest and most significant achieve ments of man, that does not mean that it is so difficult that no possible use can be made of it in first year algebra. True, indeed, until the seventeenth century, the mathematicians groped about blindly to find a principle of such a fundamental nature that it could be used to unify all of their knowledge. But now that they have bequeathed it to us, we are beginning to wonder if it is not far reaching enough in its significance to simplify and clarify what would otherwise be a somewhat unrelated mass of meaningless processes and manipulations even in first year algebra. Consider for a moment the role played by the theory of evolu tion in natural science. It is, I believe, a similar example of a unifying principle by means of which the phenomena of natural science are organized and explained even in the very elementary phases of the subject. It is a mode of thought not too difficult in its simpler aspects for even the young student to grasp. Since it is the method of thinking used by the natural scientist, we start to interpret the phenomena of natural science in the light of it. Because this theory was developed late in the history of man, it does not follow that it is fundamentally more difficult to understand than earlier notions concerning the subject. It is not necessary to know all about it to use it very effectively in in terpreting many facts satisfactorily and in relating them all about a central core, and thus to simplify enormously the explan ation of many phenomena. The function concept may become to mathematics what the theory of evolution is to natural science? a beautiful example of crude and blundering methods being pushed aside to be replaced by a method much more powerful and much more far reaching in its field of usefulness. The National Committee on the Reorganization of Mathematics recommends: \"The one great idea which is best adapted to unify the course is that of the functional relation. The primary and underlying principle of the course should be the idea of re relationships between variables.\" But hoTv are we to make use \\n88 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER of this recommendation ? This small detail is left entirely to us. In the amount of time allowed for this paper only a very limited treatment of this subject will be possible, so I would like to make some suggestions for the application of the function idea to the solution of verbal problems. It seems to me that the verbal problems should hold the most important place in the course and that symbolic manipulation should be a secondary part of the work. The pupil must understand the four fundamental oper ations with integers and fractions, a little of factoring?in short he must acquire various skills in handling symbols. But for what purpose? Chiefly that he may have the tools which make it possible for him to handle the equations which he sets up in the solutions of verbal problems. It is this type of problem which gives him an opportunity to think about quantities in their relationships to one another and to make some practical appli cations of the processes which he has learned. If more stress is placed upon verbal problems, there will be less time for the purely mechanical aspects of algebra, but even so it seems to me that there is much to gain. Some of us still spend time teaching complicated problems in complex fractions, long problems in multiplication, division, extraction of roots of polynomials, for all of which there is little or no chance for application in elementary algebra. The demands of the equation are rather simple but the pupil must be thoroughly familiar with all the symbolic manipu lations which he will need to use in solving his equations. But if we spend more time on the verbal problem and teach some of this mechanical work in connection with the equations derived, the pupil will see its use and he will have more enthusiasm for the drill work which is necessary for its mastery. It is through the verbal problem, I believe, that the child is likely to get the most from algebra that is truly educative. It is here that his mind has the best opportunity to take hold of quantitative relations and to understand the \"why\\'* of the things that he does rather than just the \"how\" to follow blindly certain rules. When it comes to the solution of verbal problems under our present method of teaching them, the pupil is likely to come to the conclusion that they are not very important since we have only a few of them now and then. Furthermore, he is likely to take the attitude that they are solved mainly by hit and miss or haphazard methods which consist largely of guessing and \\nFUNCTION CONCEPT 89 trying first one thing and then another ; that there is no general method of analysis which applies to all such problems. If through a consideration of the idea of relationships some fairly general method of analysis could be found, it seems to me that this would be a great aid in developing the ability of our pupils to do orderly thinking. Perhaps we may be able to find a better way to relate and connect the work with verbal problems so that the pupil will feel more keenly that his skill at solving such problems is in creasing with each problem solved. I find that very few teachers who have written any thing at all on the use of the function concept have attempted to give any definite suggestions for its application. They prefer to play safe and make their remarks very general. However, Mr. Paul Ligda of the McClymonds High School, Oakland, California, has just written a book on the Teaching of Elementary Algebra which suggests such a plan. I found this quite interesting, so I shall review it briefly for you. Most of the verbal problems with which we deal in first year algebra are governed by a general formula R = SxT which has also the other two aspects : R ? R A few examples of these are as follows : D = RxT (uniform rate formula) S = AxB (surface area of rectangle, parallelogram, square) I = RxP (interest formula) C = NxP (cost formula) Also each of these problems deals with either one or two situ ations, and each of these situations is governed by a general or characteristic formula connecting the unlike quantities involved. Here is an illustration : \"A man has 22 minutes to go to the station a distance of 2 miles. If he takes a car which travels at the rate of 1 mile in 8 minutes, at what distance from the station can he get out and walk, if he walks at the rate of 1 mile in 16 minutes ? \\'7 \\n90 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER This problem contains two situations : the riding situation and the walking situation. The quantities entering each of these situations are time, rate and distance and they are governed by the uniform rate formula D = RxT. This formula gives the re lationship among unlike quantities in each situation which is not given in the problem but it is a simple relationship governed by a general formula which the pupil knows. The problem con tains statements which connect like quantities in the two situ ations. Let us now exhibit the relationships existing among the quanti ties involved in this problem by means of a schematic problem. Let D = RxT represent the quantities entering the walking situation and d = rt (small letters) represent the quantities entering the riding situation. The implied relations connecting like quantities in the two situations are : (1) D -j- d = 2 (The total distance which the man walks and rides is 2 miles) (2) + t = 22 min. (The total time spent in riding and walking is 22 minutes.) (3) The problem gives explicitly the values -? = Me mile per minute ; r = ys mile per minute. Write vertically the characteristic formula governing each situation. Then summarize all of the relationships between quantities thus : Walking Riding D + d = 2 ?- r-ys + * ? 22 Read horizontally this diagram shows the way in which like quantities in the two situations are related to each other. Read vertically it shows how unlike quantities in each of the two situ ations are related to each other. The problem is now translated into symbols. If any relationship were missing the diagram would automatically indicate that. Now that every quantity is either completely described or related we are ready for the sym \\nFUNCTION CONCEPT 91 bolic solution by means of substitution and elimination. To da this eliminate R and r by substituting their numerical values. 16D == 8d = t 16D + 8d = 22 Z) + d = 2 Solve these two simultaneous linear equations for D and d. Translate the result back into words and prove the solution is correct. As here illustrated, most of the verbal problems solved in first year algebra are problems that contain two statements and thus can be expressed by means of two equations. The method of solution used by practical mathematicians in solving a problem is that of writing down the possible equations and substituting. Why then not introduce simultaneous equations early in the course and let the student obtain a thorough training in substi tution, and evaluation ; the methods used in work with formulae ? This use of simultaneous equations is an essential feature of the method of solving verbal problems by the relationship method. In order to analyze the problem we need as many symbols as there are quantities involved. As long as we adhere to the method of expressing all the quantities in terms of one quantity, preferably the smallest, any general method for analyzing prob lems is not possible. But if we use a symbol for each quantity and set forth the relationships by means of the diagram, then we can proceed in a systematic manner to eliminate quantities as a part of our symbolic solution. This type of analysis and solution will apply to most of the problems not in first year algebra. Let us summarize the steps : I. Analysis (based on function concept, the relationship among quantities). 1. Division of the problem into situations. 2. Recognition of characteristic formula. 3. Write characteristic formula vertically. 4. Division of problem into statements. a. Completely describing a quantity. b. Explicitly stating a relation between like quan tities in two situations. c. Recognition of implied statements. \\n92 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER II. Translation into symbols. III. Symbolic Solution. (Based on equation law.) IV. Translating* Result back into words. V. Check. If instead of the usual academic verbal problems, we restate the problems giving them an industrial setting, the practical minded student will take more interest in them. The problem previously used in the illustration may be reworded as follows : \"A contractor has 22 days to finish a contract to remove 2,000 tons of rock. If he rents a large steam shovel which can handle 1,000 tons in 8 days, how long should he keep it if his own shovel can handle 1,000 tons in 16 days ? \\' \\' That this is exactly the same problem as the one which he have previously solved is seen by a glance at the relationship diagram. Big Shovel Little Shovel A + a = 2 X X -f- t == 22 The result is the same only the numbers have a different mean ing. Perhaps this method of analysis which is suggested and further elaborated by Mr. Ligda is sufficiently general to make it a valu able aid in the teaching of verbal problems. If it does train the pupil to be constantly watching for relationships among quanti ties, it is surely worthy of consideration. I believe that we are making a practical application of the function concept in first year algebra when our pupils take that attitude toward verbal problems. A further application of this method to some problems chosen from a certain well-known first year algebra may prove inter esting. \\nFUNCTION CONCEPT 93 \"Two automobiles started at the same time from the same point in opposite directions. The first traveled miles more per hour than the second. At the end of 8 hours they were 360 miles apart. At what rate did each travel ? \\' \\' Analysis : There are two situations : Automobile A traveling one direction, Automobile traveling the opposite direction. The characteristic formula governing both situations is uni form rate formula d = rt since the related quantities involved are distance, rate, time. Use capitals D = R, for situation A, and small letters d = rxt for situation B. Write these characteristic formulas vertically. A D + cZ = 360 R = r + 5 = t = 8 Divide the problem into statements. 1. Sum of the distance traveled by the two autos is 360 miles. Then D + d = 360. 2. The rate of the first auto equals the rate of the second in creased by 5 miles. Then R = r + . 3. Both autos traveled the same length of time?8 hours. Translate into symbols and locate the translated symbols in the diagram. Symbolic solution: Eliminate and t by substituting their values SR == D 8r = d. In D d = 360, substitute 8? for D and 8r for d and get SR -f 8r = 360 R = r + Solve these two equations simultaneously for R and r. r = 20 R _ r + 5 = 2 . Translate the result into words. Check. \\n94 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER Second example: A boy, Albert, weighing 85 pounds, sits 7 feet from the fulcrum and balances a boy, John, who is sitting 6 feet from the fulcrum on the other side. What is the weight of the boy, John ? Analysis: There are two situations in this problem, Albert sitting on one side of the fulcrum and John sitting on the other. The characteristic formula governing both situations is L = WxB. (The law of the lever.) Use capitals L *= WxB for the situation created by Albert and 1 = wxd /or the situation created by John. Write these char acteristic formulas vertically. Albert J ohn L = 1 85 == W w 7 = D <7 = 6 Divide the problem into statements. Albert weighs 85 pounds. Albert sits 7 feet from the fulcrum. John sits 6 feet from the fulcrum. L = 1 (law of leverage). Translate into symbols and locate these symbols in the diagram. Symbolic Solution: L = 1 WxD = wxd. Eliminate W, D, and d by substituting their values. 85.7 ? Wx6 w = 99% pounds. Translate the result into words. Check. If we are to make a practical application of the use of the function concept in first year algebra, we must aim constantly to develop in our pupils the power to understand the relation ships that exist among quantities. A proper emphasis upon the study of verbal problems seems to offer the best possibility for \\nFUNCTION CONCEPT 95 realizing this aim. It is here that the pupil has presented the kind of situations which develop the \"why\" and the \"what for\\'\\' and the \"what happens if attitude toward the quantitative side of life. Here he cultivates the habit of expecting to understand rather than just the ability to use rules after he has been shown \"how.\" Some points of view which I believe are important in helping us to make the best use of the verbal problem for de veloping this type of quantitative thinking are : First : There must be no teaching of functional theory as such. The teacher must constantly bear in mind that the aim of the course is to develop skill in functional thinking, but in working toward this end, it will not be necessary even to mention the word \"function.\" I am well aware of the fact that there is much disagreement on this point. Many of my co-workers be lieve that since the function concept is so fundamental to an understanding of mathematics in later courses, we should begin to use the word i i function \\' \\' even in first year algebra ; to intro duce even then the notion that one variable is a function of an other variable. They claim that since a thorough appreciation of this notion is so necessary, it must be presented many times before the student is able to grasp it, and that it is advisable to teach some functional theory even in first year algebra. But since the word \\' \\' function \\' \\' has a much different meaning in com mon parlance than it has in mathematics, I believe that it is better to use such expressions as : \" the value of y depends upon the value of rather than \"t/ is a function of x!r For example, it is better to say, \\'i distance depends upon rate and time rather than i distance is a function of rate and time. \\' \\' A very informal treatment of the function theory seems to me to be all that is either necessary or desirable in this first year of algebra. Second: An early introduction of the study of the graph and tables which show relationships between numbers which change together is advisable. This is a type of work which the children enjoy?but that is not all, they work at it from an understanding point of view?just the attitude that we want them to get toward every phase of algebra. It may be noted here that not all of the work with graphs and tables which we usually do is functional in nature. Statistical graphs could not be considered as of much value in developing the idea of a continuous variation among \\n96 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER variables, but such graphs as those showing the relationship be tween principal and interest, or cost and number are examples of the kind that do develop this idea. The study of the graph and table makes it possible very soon to introduce the formula and simultaneous linear equations. This early introduction of simultaneous equations seems advis able if verbal problems are to be treated from the viewpoint of the relationships involved among quantities. Most problems con tain two situations, so can be more easily expressed and solved by two equations than by only one, thus avoiding the necessity of expressing all of the unknown quantities in terms of one. Chil dren occasionally discover almost unaided, the method of solving problems by simultaneous equations some time before the middle of the second semester when the subject is usually introduced. Just recently, I was trying to teach some verbal problems which are supposed to lead to fractional equations involving one un known. After school, a boy whom I shall call John, came to me about a problem which he said he had not yet been able to solve. Here is the problem: \"Separate 45 into two parts such that % of the greater exceeds y2 of the less by 6.\" John said: \"There are two numbers to be found here, are there not? Why can\\'t you use two different letters?one to represent each ? If you add them you get 45. If you add 6 to half of the small one you get % of the greater one. Isn\\'t there any way to find both these num bers this way ? \\' \\' It occurred to me that John was about as near ready to learn something about simultaneous linear equations as he would ever be. What should I have done with him ? Third: After the equation has been obtained it must be solved without juggling or artificial devices. The pupil should be able to justify every step with good reasons and the word \"transpose\" when applied to an equation should not be in his vocabulary. It is an enemy to an understanding attitude of mind. Let him look upon his equation as a question which asks him to find the value of some unknown number. He may write it thus until he is thoroughly familiar with its interrogative nature. 5x + 8 = 24 ? Sx \\nFUNCTION CONCEPT 97 For what value of is this statement true? There is but one equation law which he need consider. \"Whatever is done to one member of this equality must also be done to the other.\" Let him assume that he has two equal numbers 5x + 8 and 24 ? Sx. If he wants to know what 5x equals he may find out by subtract ing 8 from the left members, but in order to preserve the equality or balance, he must also subtract 8 from the right members. This gives 5x = 16 ? Sx. In the right member he now has Sx less than 16. If Sx be added to the right member the result will be 16 and clearly now the right member contains no term. If then Sx be added to both members of this equation, the balance will not be destroyed. 8x = 16. Divide both members of this equation by 8, to find the value of lx. It may appear to be more laborious to think of all of these additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and the like in all such cases, but when the pupil handles the equation this way he understands what he is doing. He is not just juggling symbols. Fourth: We must ever bear in mind that the main purpose of algebra is to develop the powers of reason. The habit of ap proaching a problem from the viewpoint of studying the relation ships among the quantities involved is a type of thinking which is directly useful to the pupil whether he goes to college or not. The ability to think in terms of relationships among quantities, space and variables is often required of all intelligent human beings?hence there is ever a field in real life into which this type of training can \"transfer.\" In the affairs of real life, good citizens are constantly called upon to estimate, to compare or to see clearly the relations between variable quantities even when exact computations are not made. Hence it appears that the final computation in connections with equations is not so valu able a training as the thinking required to formulate the equa tion, graph or table from the situations set forth in the problem. A proper use of the verbal problem provides excellent training in just the type of functional thinking which the pupil is sure to find very valuable. \\n98 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER If then we wish to make use of this idea of studying mathe matics from the viewpoint of the function concept it is necessary that our work be so organized that the analysis of verbal prob lems hold the most important place in the course. There should be no teaching of functional theory as such. The graph, the table and the formula are an inseperable trio for expressing re lationships among quantities which should be introduced early. Simultaneous linear equations should be introduced as soon as their use makes it possible to solve problems more readily. Sym bolic manipulation can be taught as we go along, chiefly as the pupil needs it to help him in the solution of the equations which he sets up. It must be possible for a pupil to give a satisfactory reason for every step which he takes in solving an equation? there must be no juggling. The pupil must develop his ability to see relationships among quantities for this is the very essence of intelligence. \\n'"

      "In Plato's division of the liberal arts into the trivium and the quadrivium, the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of arithmetic and geometry. This structure was continued in the structure of classical education that was developed in medieval Europe. Teaching of geometry was almost universally based on Euclid's Elements. Apprentices to trades such as masons, merchants and money-lenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession.\n",
      "The first mathematics textbooks to be written in English and French were published by Robert Recorde, beginning with The Grounde of Artes in 1540. However, there are many different writings on mathematics and mathematics methodology that date back to 1800 BCE. These were mostly located in Mesopotamia where the Sumerians were practicing multiplication and division. There are also artifacts demonstrating their own methodology for solving equations like the quadratic equation. After the Sumerians some of the most famous ancient works on mathematics come from Egypt in the form of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus. The more famous Rhind Papyrus has been dated to approximately 1650 BCE but it is thought to be a copy of an even older scroll. This papyrus was essentially an early textbook for Egyptian students.\n",
      "In the Renaissance, the academic status of mathematics declined, because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce. Although it continued to be taught in European universities, it was seen as subservient to the study of Natural, Metaphysical and Moral Philosophy.\n",
      "This trend was somewhat reversed in the seventeenth century, with the University of Aberdeen creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by the Chair in Geometry being set up in University of Oxford in 1619 and the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics being established by the University of Cambridge in 1662. However, it was uncommon for mathematics to be taught outside of the universities. Isaac Newton, for example, received no formal mathematics teaching until he joined Trinity College, Cambridge in 1661.\n",
      "In the 18th and 19th centuries, the industrial revolution led to an enormous increase in urban populations. Basic numeracy skills, such as the ability to tell the time, count money and carry out simple arithmetic, became essential in this new urban lifestyle. Within the new public education systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.\n",

      "At different times and in different cultures and countries, mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives. These objectives have included:\n",
      "\n",
      "The teaching and learning of basic numeracy skills to all pupils\n",
      "The teaching of practical mathematics (arithmetic, elementary algebra, plane and solid geometry, trigonometry) to most pupils, to equip them to follow a trade or craft\n",

      "The teaching of heuristics and other problem-solving strategies to solve non-routine problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods[edit]\n",
      "The method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve. Methods of teaching mathematics include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Classical education: the teaching of mathematics within the quadrivium, part of the classical education curriculum of the Middle Ages, which was typically based on Euclid's Elements taught as a paradigm of deductive reasoning.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-based math an approach based around use of mathematical software as the primary tool of computation.\n",
      "Conventional approach: the gradual and systematic guiding through the hierarchy of mathematical notions, ideas and techniques. Starts with arithmetic and is followed by Euclidean geometry and elementary algebra taught concurrently. Requires the instructor to be well informed about elementary mathematics, since didactic and curriculum decisions are often dictated by the logic of the subject rather than pedagogical considerations. Other methods emerge by emphasizing some aspects of this approach.\n",
      "Exercises: the reinforcement of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type, such as adding vulgar fractions or solving quadratic equations.\n",
      "Historical method: teaching the development of mathematics within an historical, social and cultural context. Provides more human interest than the conventional approach.,[3]\n",
      "Mastery: an approach in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing\n",
      "New Math: a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as set theory, functions and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US as a response to the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was Morris Kline's 1973 book Why Johnny Can't Add. The New Math method was the topic of one of Tom Lehrer's most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: \"...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer.\"\n",
      "Problem solving: the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity, creativity and heuristic thinking by setting students open-ended, unusual, and sometimes unsolved problems. The problems can range from simple word problems to problems from international mathematics competitions such as the International Mathematical Olympiad. Problem solving is used as a means to build new mathematical knowledge, typically by building on students' prior understandings.\n",
      "Recreational mathematics: Mathematical problems that are fun can motivate students to learn mathematics and can increase enjoyment of mathematics.[4]\n",
      "Standards-based mathematics: a vision for pre-college mathematics education in the US and Canada, focused on deepening student understanding of mathematical ideas and procedures, and formalized by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics which created the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.\n",
      "Relational approach: Uses class topics to solve everyday problems and relates the topic to current events.[5] This approach focuses on the many uses of mathematics and helps students understand why they need to know it as well as helping them to apply mathematics to real world situations outside of the classroom.\n",
      "Rote learning: the teaching of mathematical results, definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically without meaning or supported by mathematical reasoning. A derisory term is drill and kill. In traditional education, rote learning is used to teach multiplication tables, definitions, formulas, and other aspects of mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Content and age levels[edit]\n",
      "Different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages and in somewhat different sequences in different countries. Sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age than typical as a special or honors class.\n",
      "Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught in a similar fashion, though there are differences. In the United States fractions are typically taught starting from 1st grade, whereas in other countries they are usually taught later, since the metric system does not require young children to be familiar with them.[citation needed] Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States.[6] K-12 topics include elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and pre-algebra.\n",
      "In most of the U.S., algebra, geometry and analysis (pre-calculus and calculus) are taught as separate courses in different years of high school. Mathematics in most other countries (and in a few U.S. states) is integrated, with topics from all branches of mathematics studied every year. Students in many countries choose an option or pre-defined course of study rather than choosing courses à la carte as in the United States. Students in science-oriented curricula typically study differential calculus and trigonometry at age 16–17 and integral calculus, complex numbers, analytic geometry, exponential and logarithmic functions, and infinite series in their final year of secondary school. Probability and statistics may be taught in secondary education classes.\n",
      "Science and engineering students in colleges and universities may be required to take multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra. Applied mathematics is also used in specific majors; for example, civil engineers may be required to study fluid mechanics,[7] while \"math for computer science\" might include graph theory, permutation, probability, and proofs.[8] Mathematics students would continue to study potentially any area.\n",
      "Standards[edit]\n",
      "Throughout most of history, standards for mathematics education were set locally, by individual schools or teachers, depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to, realistic for, and considered socially appropriate for their pupils.\n",
      "In modern times, there has been a move towards regional or national standards, usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum. In England, for example, standards for mathematics education are set as part of the National Curriculum for England,[9] while Scotland maintains its own educational system. In the USA, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers have published the national mathematics Common Core State Standards Initiative.\n",
      "Ma (2000) summarised the research of others who found, based on nationwide data, that students with higher scores on standardised mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.[10]\n",
      "In North America, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has published the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, which boosted the trend towards reform mathematics. In 2006, they released Curriculum Focal Points, which recommend the most important mathematical topics for each grade level through grade 8. However, these standards are enforced as American states and Canadian provinces choose. A US state's adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics is at the discretion of the state, and is not mandated by the Federal Government. [11]\"States routinely review their academic standards and may choose to change or add onto the standards to best meet the needs of their students.\" [12]\n",

      "\"Robust, useful theories of classroom teaching do not yet exist\".[13] However, there are useful theories on how children learn mathematics and much research has been conducted in recent decades to explore how these theories can be applied to teaching. The following results are examples of some of the current findings in the field of mathematics education:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important results[13]\n",
      "One of the strongest results in recent research is that the most important feature in effective teaching is giving students \"opportunity to learn\". Teachers can set expectations, time, kinds of tasks, questions, acceptable answers, and type of discussions that will influence students' opportunity to learn. This must involve both skill efficiency and conceptual understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conceptual understanding[13]\n",
      "Two of the most important features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.[14]) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Deliberate, productive struggle with mathematical ideas refers to the fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the end result is greater learning. This has been shown to be true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Formative assessment[15]\n",
      "Formative assessment is both the best and cheapest way to boost student achievement, student engagement and teacher professional satisfaction. Results surpass those of reducing class size or increasing teachers' content knowledge. Effective assessment is based on clarifying what students should know, creating appropriate activities to obtain the evidence needed, giving good feedback, encouraging students to take control of their learning and letting students be resources for one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Homework[16]\n",
      "Homework which leads students to practice past lessons or prepare future lessons are more effective than those going over today's lesson. Students benefit from feedback. Students with learning disabilities or low motivation may profit from rewards. For younger children, homework helps simple skills, but not broader measures of achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Students with difficulties[16]\n",
      "Students with genuine difficulties (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with basic facts, answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor number sense and have poor short-term memory. Techniques that have been found productive for helping such students include peer-assisted learning, explicit teaching with visual aids, instruction informed by formative assessment and encouraging students to think aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Algebraic reasoning[16]\n",
      "It is important for elementary school children to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle with the concept of variable. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. It takes time to move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the equals sign to mean \"the answer is....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Methodology[edit]\n",
      "As with other educational research (and the social sciences in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods in order to test their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.\n",
      "Qualitative research, such as case studies, action research, discourse analysis, and clinical interviews, depend on small but focused samples in an attempt to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood why treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to \"lethal mutations\"[13] of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences.[17] Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.\n",
      "Randomized trials[edit]\n",
      "There has been some controversy over the relative strengths of different types of research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes.[18][19] In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments.[20][21] Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods.[19] On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective,[22] or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.[23]\n",
      "In the United States, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (NMAP) published a report in 2008 based on studies, some of which used randomized assignment of treatments to experimental units, such as classrooms or students. The NMAP report's preference for randomized experiments received criticism from some scholars.[24] In 2010, the What Works Clearinghouse (essentially the research arm for the Department of Education) responded to ongoing controversy by extending its research base to include non-experimental studies, including regression discontinuity designs and single-case studies.[25]\n",

    "### Calculus with a Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is an introduction to the foundational ideas in Calculus.  Integration, differentiation, and differential equations are introduced to familiarize students with the discipline and to show it's applications to a wide variety of problems.  We will use the computer and introduce the Python computer language to complete our work. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the mathematical concepts and history of Integration\n",
    "- Use integration to solve problems\n",
    "- Understand the mathematical concept and history of Differentiation\n",
    "- Use differentiation to solve problems\n",
    "- Connect Integration and Differentiation through Differential Equations and explore the history of these problems\n",
    "- Use differential equations to solve problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Course\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work on each of the topics listed for 1  class.  This will involve viewing instructional videos in advance of class, and considering a few brief problems.  You will bring your ideas to class to complete a problem set with peers that will be submitted and graded weekly.  In addition to these problems, you will complete a short project for each section that goes deeper in a particular area as discussed in class.  These will result in a short group video presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the course, we will complete short review problem sets and work on a final project that builds out an earlier project investigation.  This will result in an individual video presentation and paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of the course, students will have a portfolio of problem sets, group projects, and individual research work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely heavily on peers and open collaboration on our assignments.  Students are free to ask and post responses in our Piazza discussion board, available here:  [https://piazza.com/newschool/spring2018/lmth2040/home](https://piazza.com/newschool/spring2018/lmth2040/home).\n",
